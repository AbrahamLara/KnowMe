## KnowMe frontend server

This project utilizes React as the frontend server. Other libraries used on top of react is reactstrap and react-transition-group for fade in and out effects. React redux is being utilized to handle updating UI based on loading, authentication, registration, and errors. For HTTP request the axios library is used. There is still room for improvement and refactoring.
